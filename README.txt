Two JS files included:
1. a5.js: The original assignment JS file with the original wall textures. This includes some effects such as the animated floor texture and the animated sun (light source)
2. a51.js: New JS file with a space-like environment (new and animated texture for the cube map)

During the sumulation, press 'O' to toggle the sun's revolution on and off.

THANK YOU! :-)
